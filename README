4.3. INSTALLING AN ICON THEME
=============================
If you run OpenSesame you may find that many icons are missing. This is because
OpenSesame requires the Faenza icon theme, which needs to be installed
separately. You can obtain Faenza from here:

  <http://tiheum.deviantart.com/art/Faenza-Icons-173323228>

Download, extract, and place the Faenza folder in any location that is searched
for icon themes. For example as

  [OpenSesame folder]/resources/theme/default/Faenza
