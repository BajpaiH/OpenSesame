<h1>Feedback items</h2>

<p>Feedback items can be used to inform participants of their performance.
Feedback items are very similar to sketchpad items, but differ in the
moment at which they are prepared. Feedback items are not prepared in advance,
which means that they can contain up-to-date information about response times,
etc. On the other, this also means that they may introduce a small delay in
your experiment, which is why you should not use them for the presentation of
time-critical displays.</p>

<p>One way to give feedback would be to add something the following text to
your feedback item:</p>

<p class='mono'>Your average response time was [avg_rt] ms</p>
