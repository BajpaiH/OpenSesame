<h1>OpenSesame help</h1>

can browse the online documentation by clicking

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>OpenSesame is a graphical experiment builder for the social sciences. It
allows you to easily create experiments, using a point-and-click graphical
interface. For complex tasks, OpenSesame supports
<a href='http://www.python.org/'>Python</a> scripting.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>The best way to get started is to follow the tutorial and/ or take a look at
example experiments. This, and much more, can be found online in the
<a href='http://osdoc.cogsci.nl'>OpenSesame documentation area</a>.

<h2>Interface</h2>

<p>The graphical interface consists of the following parts. You can get context
sensitive help by clicking on the help icons at the top-right of each tab.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <b>menu</b> (at the top of the window) offers a variety of options,
	such as opening and closing files, inserting items (see below) and checking
	for updates. The menu cannot be hidden or closed.</li>
	
	<li>The <b>main toolbar</b> (the big buttons below the menu) offers a
	selection of the most relevant options from the menu. The main toolbar
	cannot be hidden, but it can be moved or detached from the main window.</li>
	
	<li>The <b>item toolbar</b> (the big buttons on the left of the window)
	displays a list of available items. You can drag items from the items
	toolbar into the overview of the experiment. The items toolbar cannot be
	hidden, but it can be moved or detached from the main window.</li>
	
	<li>The <b>tab area</b> contains the tabs that are used to edit the
	experiment. If you click on an item in the 'overview' window, a
	corresponding tab will be opened in the tab area. Help is displayed in the
	tab area as well. The tab area cannot be moved or hidden.</li>
	
	<li>The <b>overview area</b> provides an overview of your experiment. The
	structure of your experiment is visualized as a tree. The overview item
	can be hidden, moved and detached from the main window.</li>
	
	<li>The <b>file pool</b> (Control + P) provides an overview of the files
	that are bundled with your experiment. If you save your experiment in the
	.opensesame.tar.gz format, the file pool will be saved along with your
	experiment. The file pool can be hidden, moved, and detached from the main
	window.</li>
	
	<li>The <b>variable inspector</b> (Control + I) provides an overview of the
	variables that are used in your experiment. The variable inspector can be
	hidden, moved, and detached from the main window.</li>

	<li>The <b>debug window</b>. (Control + D) shows the messages that are
	written to the standard output during an experiment. This is mostly useful
	for debugging inline_script items. A Python interpreter is provided as
	well. The debug window can be hidden, moved, and detached from the main
	window.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Items</h2>

<p>Items are the building blocks of your experiment. There are 10 core items
that provide the basic functionality that is necessary to create an experiment.
Core items can be dragged into to your experiment from the item toolbar.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <b>loop</b> item runs another item multiple times. You can also
	define independent variables in the loop item.</li>
	
	<li>The <b>sequence</b> item runs multiple other items in sequence.</li>
	
	<li>The <b>sketchpad</b> item presents visual stimuli. A built-in drawing
	tool allows you to easily create stimulus displays.</li>
	
	<li>The <b>feedback</b> item is similar to a sketchpad, but is not prepared
	in advance. Therefore, a feedback item can be used to present feedback to
	the participants.</li>
	
	<li>The <b>sampler</b> item plays back a single sound file.</li>
	
	<li>The <b>synth</b> item generates a single sound.</li>
	
	<li>The <b>keyboard_response</b> item collects keypress responses.</li>
	
	<li>The <b>mouse_response</b> item collects mouseclick responses.</li>
	
	<li>The <b>logger</b> item writes variables to the log file.</li>
	
	<li>The <b>inline_script</b> item allows you to execute Python code and
	offers a built-in programming editor.</li>
</ul>

<p>If installed, <b>plug-in</b> items provide additional functionality.
Plug-ins appear alongside the core items in the item toolbar. An overview of
available plug-ins can be found
<a href='<http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/plug-ins/list-of-available-plug-ins'>online</a>.

<h2>Running your experiment</h2>

<p>You can run your experiment in full-screen mode (Control+R; Run -> Run
fullscreen) or in a window (Control+W; Run -> Run in window). When the
'auto-response' option (Run -> Enable auto-response) is enabled, OpenSesame will
simulate keypress and mouseclick responses, which can be useful when testing
your experiment.</p>

<h2>Saving your experiment</h2>

<p>Experiments can be saved in two file formats:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>.opensesame</b> files contain only the experiment script. Therefore,
	the file pool will not be saved along with your experiment when saving in
	.opensesame format. The .opensesame format is a plain-text format.</li>
	
	<li>.opensesame.tar.gz files contain the experiment script and all the files
	from the file pool. The .opensesame.tar.gz format is a .tar.gz compressed
	archive, which can be opened with most file compression tools.</li>
</ul>
