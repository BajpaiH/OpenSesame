<h1>Inline_script items</h1>

<p>You can do a lot with the graphical interface of OpenSesame, but for certain
complex tasks you will have to use scripting/ programming. This is where the
inline_script item comes in. You can use regular
<a href='http://www.python.org'>Python</a> code in your inline script. Python is a
modern, powerful and high-level programming language. There are numerous
libraries available for Python, so there is really no limit to what you can do
using inline_script items.</p>

<p>The inline_script item contains two scripts. The Prepare phase script is
called first, before the sequence that contains the inline_script is executed.
This allows you to do perform some time consuming tasks in advance, so that the
Run phase goes smoothly. The Run phase script is called during the actual
running of the sequence that the inline_script is part of. So if you want to
present a stimulus display in your inline_script, it is good practice to
construct the display in the Prepare phase and show it in the Run phase. Note
that this is purely a convention, from which you can deviate as circumstances
dictate.</p>
