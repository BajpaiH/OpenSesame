<h1>Keyboard_response items</h1>

<p>The keyboard_response item is the primary way to collect keypress responses.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<ul>
	<li><b>Correct response</b> is the name of the expected response. Usually 
	you will set the correct_response variable elsewhere (e.g., in a loop item)
	and you can leave this field empty.</li>

	<li><b>Allowed responses</b> is a semicolon-separated list of keys that are
	accepted, e.g., 'a;b;/'.</li>

	<li><b>Timeout</b> contains a maximum response time in milliseconds or
	'infinite' for no timeout.</li>

	<li><b>Flush pending keypresses</b> indicates that old, pending responses
	should be discarded.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Variables set by keyboard_response</h2>

<ul>
	<li><b>response</b> is the name of the response key.</li>

	<li><b>response_time</b> is the time between the start of the response
	interval and the response.</li>

	<li><b>correct</b> is 1 if the response matches the correct_response and 0
	otherwise.</li>

	<li><b>avg_rt</b> or <b>average_response_time</b> is the average response
	time since the last feedback item.</li>

	<li><b>acc</b> or <b>accuracy</b> is the average percentage of correct
	responses since the last feedback item.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Names of keys</h2>

<p>Keys are generally identified by their character and/ or their description
(depending on which is applicable). For example, the '/' key is identified as
'slash' and '/'. The 'a' is just identified as 'a'. The left arrow is just
identified as 'left'. For a full list of available key names, click on the 'List
available keys' button.</p>
