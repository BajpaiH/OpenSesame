<h1>Logger items</h1>

<p><i>Always triple-check whether OpenSesame has logged all relevant variables!
</i></p>

<p>The logger item is the primary way to log your data to file.</p>

<h2>Selecting variables</h2>

<p>In the logger item you can indicate which variables you wish to log. By
default the logger tries to auto-detect and log all variables. This is a safe
bet, but results in large datafiles, with lots of unnecessary information. If
you deselect the auto-detect option, you can select variables from the list,
which contains all (global) variables that OpenSesame is aware of. If, for some
reason, the variable that you want to log does not appear in the list, you can
add it using the 'Add custom variable' button. If you are unsure which variables
you want to log, you can click on the Smart select button, which will select all
variables that are likely to be of interest.</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<ul>
	<li><b>Use 'NA' for variables that have not been set</b> indicates that the
	logger should not throw an exception when a variable has not been set. This
	can be useful when you want to log a variable that has not been set the
	first time that the logger item is called.</li>
	
	<li><b>Automatically detect and log all variables</b> indicates that the
	logger should auto-detect and log all variables.</li>
	
	<li><b>Allow secial characters in log file</b> indicates that the logger
	should not convert special characters to U+XXXX notation. This makes the
	logfile easier to read if you use many special characters or a non-western
	font.</li>
	
	<li><b>Put quotes around values</b> indicates that fields in the logfile
	should be put in quotes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Format of the logfile</h2>

<p>The logfile is in plain-text, comma-separated format. This format can be
viewed in most text-editors (although Windows Notepad may not handle the
line-endings properly) and spreadsheets.</p>

<h2>Merging data files</h2>

<p>If you prefer to have all participant data in a single spreadsheet, you can
merge the OpenSesame logfiles using the
