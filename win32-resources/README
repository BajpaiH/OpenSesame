WIN32 BUILD RESOURCES
=====================
You can build OpenSesame for Windows by executing the following command from the
OpenSesame root folder.

c:\Python26\Python.exe win32-resources\setup.py py2exe

The build script makes a couple of assumptions:
- Python 2.6 is installed in c:\Python26
- Py2exe is installed
- The media_player plugin source is located in the same folder as OpenSesame, 
  e.g, "c:\git\opensesame" and "c:\git\media_player"
